The template in here is a GIMP format template to create custom insignia (e.g. if you want unique squad names, rather than the defaults). 

Colours are not set, but try and stick to the matching colours in the groupMarkers for consistency.

CO - Yellow
Alpha/1st Squad - Red
Bravo/2nd Squad - Blue
Charlie/3rd Squad - Green

Simply use the template and then convert to PAA using Arma 3 Tools via Steam. 
Match the names to the faction the playable unit are (e.g. NATO/AAF/CSAT), and replace the default files.

If you need to add extra squads over the ones set up already, they need assigning in the define.hpp and fn_assignInsignia.sqf
It's a fairly simple set up, just copy the formatting of the other entries.
